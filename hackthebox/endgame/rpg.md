## Description:

Roundsoft Inc. is a startup with a mission to develop the best video games the world has ever seen.

Safeguarding the company's intellectual property from corporate espionage and other external threats is their highest priority. Roundsoft has enlisted the services of your pentesting company, with a scope to determine if their perimeter can be breached, leading to compromise of their entire domain.

RGP is designed to test your creative thinking, enumeration & exploitation skills within a small Active Directory environment.

The goal is to identify the companyâ€™s assets, enumerate and move laterally within the network, and ultimately to compromise the domain while collecting several flags along the way.

Entry Point: 10.13.38.18 and 10.13.38.19
